		<h1>Why does Gavin Newsom love traffic so much?</h1> 
		<p>His reasons are his own, and we can only speculate as to what they are. All we can say for sure is that the Governor has set an arbitrary policy that will add thousands of additional cars to California's roadways.</p>

		<p>The policy is a <a href="https://www.aol.com/return-office-state-workers-ordered-014334259.html" target="_new">return to office (RTO) mandate that requires all California state workers to work onsite at least 2 days per week</a>, even though many state workers have been working effectively from home 5 days per week for the past four years, and in so doing have defrayed significant costs to California's taxpayers and the environment.</p>

		<p>As of November of 2023, 37% of state employees work primarily from home.<sup onclick='letitshow("footnotes")'><a href="#l1">1</a></sup> Gavin's return-to-office mandate will force an estimated 90,000 state workers on the roads throughout California; that means we can expect over 30,000 more cars in Sacramento and over 7,000 in Los Angeles during peak commuting hours.<sup onclick='letitshow("footnotes")'><a href="#l2">2</a></sup></p>

			<!-- <h3>Environmental Impacts</h3> -->
			<p>California is already <a href="https://calmatters.org/environment/climatechange/2024/03/california-climate-change-mandate-analysis/" target="_new">failing to meet its climate goals</a>,<sup onclick='letitshow("footnotes")'><a href="#l3">3</a></sup> and <a href="https://www.lung.org/research/sota/city-rankings/most-polluted-cities" target="_new">6 of the 10 most polluted cities in the country are located in California</a>.<sup onclick='letitshow("footnotes")'><a href="#l4">4</a></sup></p>					
			<p>Over the last 2.25 years, state telework policies have prevented nearly 400,000 metric tons of carbon from being released into the atmosphere from daily commutes.<sup onclick='letitshow("footnotes")'><a href="#l5">5</a></sup></p>
			
			<p>Based on the most recent month of <a href="https://www.gavinlovestraffic.com/data/" target="_new">Department of General Services' Tracking Telework data</a>, the Governor's mandate for state workers to report to office locations at least 2 days per week is estimated to create a minimum of about 63,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions over the course of a year.</p>

			<figure style='width: 80%; text-align: center; margin: auto;'>
				<img src="src/Yearly_RTO_costs.png" alt="Bar graph showing how many CO2 emissions will be created over a year due to Gavin's love of traffic." style="width:100%">
  				<figcaption><b>Figure 1.</b> Estimated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in metric tons over the course of one year (y-axis) for each number of mandated days state workers are required to report onsite (x-axis).</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>Should the 2 day mandate represent the start of a return to the pre-pandemic standard of 5 days in the office per week, the estimated CO<sub>2</sub> emitted as a result of the policy could near 250 million metric tons.</p>

			<p>Given the urgency of the climate emergency, we need to take as many measures as possible to prevent catastrophic climate change. Telework is one of many necessary tools in our toolkit to ward off climate change. <b>California can't afford RTO.</b></p>

		<p>Absent an operational reason to take 100% telework off the table for state employees, we can only assume that Gavin must love traffic, pollution, carbon emissions, and wasting everyone's time and money—or, at least, he must care more about making traffic worse than he does about meeting California's ambitious climate goals.</p>

		<h2 style="color: #DA2020;">Gavin, please reconsider. Traffic will never love you back.</h2>
